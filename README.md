# cybercafe-management
•	The basic task of our project is to provide operators and customers with an accurate timing and billing information at any time. Cyber cafe management system keeps customer accounts, so that customers can log in on their own using username and password.
	
•	The cyber cafe currently maintains the records manually. All the working hours, user names, and retain addresses daily in the record book for further reference. Due to the manual method, the processing is not up to the mark and prone to inefficiencies. Report generation is a very tedious and prone error procedure.
	

•	We created an OOPs(Object Oriented Programming) based cyber cafe management System, which will automate the whole Cyber Cafe Management. 

•	Cyber Cafe Management System is a significant place for keeping member records as per I.T., And C++ with application development tools has made it relatively easier for computer professionals to build several projects.


•	One entry should be made once and further the entries are fetched as required. This makes the system more efficient. The user can only login the system if they are authorized to do so.


•	The users of this system are required to feed up their own data giving up appropriate constraints to be able to manipulate the functioning of various highlights of the system.
